Copyrights 2022, individual artists
The text art files in arttime repository is a property of
individual artists. Given the art files were collected
from web and web archives, it is available for
personal non-commercial use. For any other use case
considered beyond personal non-commercial, unless the
artist intended to make it available for free use,
the curator of text art does not make any promises
to its licensing and assumes that an individual user
would do their own due diligence to either contact the
artist for such use and clear their intention or preserve
a copy of artist's publicly available statement that their
art is available to be used freely beyond personal non-
commericial use case. The curator of this art repository
doesn't own individual art, and is to be considered waived
from all liabilities related to its wrong use (which the
individual artist did not intend).
