# arttime
üßúüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Beauty of text art meets functionality of clock/timer ‚è∞. ``arttime`` brings curated text-art to otherwise artless terminal emulators of starving developers and other users who can use terminal. 

Purpose/features:
- Bring curated text/ascii art to artless terminals
- Provide a simple yet smart alarm/timer for commandline
- Native desktop notifications for timer, notification identifies the instance of arttime it came from
- Provide developers with 1 line under art to display their activism
- Support animated text art: flip-flop between two related ascii arts every second
- Support 24-bit RGB text art produced from jpeg, etc stickers/images/photographs
- Random art selection makes it a fun game, or serious tarot-style reading for believers in The Random
- Provide a publishing platform for text/ascii art artists (text art is meant for terminals, not museums)
- Provide a curated text art library for users 
- Provide a developer-centric experience: mindful suspension (Ctrl-z) and continuation
- Works on macOS out of the box. No need to install homebrew, developer tools
- Works on other Unixes like Linux/BSD with only zsh as the dependency
- Starts in an intuitive learn/help mode by default (turn that off with ``--nolearn``)
- For consistent art & message display in multiple applications, a script ``artprint`` is also available in the same directory as ``arttime``.

# Call for artists
Much good ascii art was created during web 1.0, but the artform declined after that. arttime intends to be a platform/repository for hosting/displaying ascii/ansi art, as ascii/ansi does have its natural home on a terminal (instead of a wall of an arts museum). In doing so it also encourages sharing art, a not so common drift with the arrival of NFTs (where monkey stickers are being priced at hundreds of thousands of US dollars). The repository already provides a curated library of good ascii art (mixed at times with computer-generated text version of digital images).

2. Default art. ``$ arttime`` then press ``h``, or ``arttime --nolearn``

3. Animated art clock. ``$ arttime --nolearn -a military -b military2 -t "Say no to wars, yes to peace" --ac 4``

4. Timer and notification. ``arttime --nolearn -a colorowl2 -b colorowl3 -t "We don't sleep at night - Owls"`` then press ``g`` to enter a goal time like ``6s`` for 6 seconds. Check more formats supported by reading help documentation ``$ arttime -h``. This is an example of colorful art too.

5. Activism and 24-bit ANSI color example ``$ arttime --nolearn -a ukraine1_40 -t "Support peace, support Ukraine"``. Note: terminal emulator must support 24-bit RGB colors.

6. Another 24-bit ANSI color (from image) example ``$ arttime --nolearn -a obama2 -t "Yes we can, yes we can drink better teas"``.  Note: terminal emulator must support 24-bit RGB colors.

7. Random art selection game, tarot-style. ``$ arttime --nolearn`` then press and hold ``j`` for a few seconds. After some time arttime will settle on some randomly selected art. Press ``y`` to select it, or ``c`` to cancel. Click on mp4 video below to play it (it's GIF makes loading this web page slow).

8. And much more... For more information read help documentation ``$ arttime -h``, and start in learn mode (default) to understand keybindings ``$ arttime``.
