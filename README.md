# arttime
üßúüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Beauty of text art meets functionality of clock/timer ‚è∞. ``arttime`` brings curated text-art to otherwise artless terminal emulators of starving developers and other users who can use terminal. 

Purpose/features:
- Bring curated text/ascii art to artless terminals
- Provide a simple yet smart alarm/timer for commandline
- Native desktop notifications for timer, notification identifies the instance of arttime it came from
- Provide developers with 1 line under art to display their activism
- Random art selection makes it a fun game, or serious tarot-style reading
- Provide a publishing platform for text/ascii art artists (text art is meant for terminals, not museums)
- Provide a curated text art library for users 
- Provide a developer-centric experience: mindful suspension (Ctrl-z) and continuation
- Works on macOS out of the box. No need to install homebrew, developer tools
- Works on other Unixes like Linux/BSD with only zsh as the dependency
- Starts in an intuitive learn/help mode by default (turn that off with ``--nolearn``)
